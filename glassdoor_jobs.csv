Description

IFC—a sister organization of the World Bank and member of the World Bank Group—is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets. We work in more than 100 countries, using our capital, expertise, and influence to create markets and opportunities in developing countries.

For more information, visit www.ifc.org

IFC’s Infrastructure and Natural Resources (INR) Department

Industries that can harness natural resources are vital for many of the world’s poorest countries. The IFC’s INR Department provides finance and advice for private sector clients and help governments adopt effective regulations and strengthen their capacity to manage these industries across the value chain. The Sustainable Infrastructure Advisory (SIA) team, within INR Department, supports companies to ensure that local communities enjoy concrete benefits from projects, focusing on transparency, supply chains, jobs, environmental stewardship, and community engagement.

Natural resources play a dominant role in social, economic, environmental and political aspects in at least 81 countries. Collectively these nations account for a quarter of the world’s GDP and half of the world’s population. Unfortunately, the abundance of natural resources does not always translate into widespread wealth distribution or growth, and can even exacerbate inequalities, conflict, and corruption. The promotion of good governance is therefore a key part of the development agenda and has risen in importance for government, private sector, and civil society alike.

The overarching goal of the “From Disclosure to Development” (D2D) program is to enhance the effectiveness of disclosures in support of achieving clear development outcomes from investments in natural resources. It is led by IFC and is implemented in collaboration with the World Bank. The program builds on the World Bank’s experience in assisting governments and civil society with open data, EITI implementation, digital government and development data innovation programs, as well as on the IFC’s extensive work to guide private and public institutions to share benefits of investments in natural resources with local communities. Implementation of Phase 2 of the Program is planned for 2020-23.

The D2D team is looking to expand its advisory services with data-driven approaches to offer clients in natural resource and infrastructure sectors (incl. transport, energy, water) new data analytics tools and to build data literacy and analysis capacity.

Description of the Assignment
The team is seeking to hire a Senior Data Scientist to:
• provide strategic and technical advice to the D2D team on opportunities to introduce data solutions to its existing and future services
• lead client-focused activities to design, pilot, and scale innovative data solutions and products (such as visualizations, dashboards, and other analytical tools to support decision making and information dissemination to communities)
• contribute to the development of the Natural Resource Data Analytics curriculum that aims to build capacity of infomediaries in resource-rich developing countries to use open data, and
• deliver pilot activities related to the roll-out of the curriculum in two countries, including serving as an instructor.

The Data Scientist will be responsible for supporting the Sustainable Infrastructure Advisory team’s operations, including developing new data analytics solutions, project management, research, and capacity building for IFC clients and stakeholders (companies, governments, communities) on opening, managing and effectively using data.

The Data Scientist will be responsible for leading identification of opportunities to develop, test, and scale data-driven solutions across the portfolio of D2D’s activities in the Program’s countries of operation, which include Colombia, Ghana, Guinea, Mongolia, Sierra Leone, and Peru.

The Data Scientist is expected to stay up to date with the latest data management techniques and applications and advise on best practices for extracting insights from data across D2D projects in the above countries. The consultant will also be expected to know and apply best practices in project management, implementation of analytical tools and research methods to support broader project needs.

Key tasks include but are not limited to the following:

Strategic and Operational Advisory Services on Data Analytics

• Identify opportunities to test and scale data-driven strategies and solutions as part of D2D in-country activities planning.
• Guide the design and operationalization of data driven products (such as interactive dashboards), bridging the D2D program vision, local stakeholders (government, private sector, NGOs) needs, and the technical capacity of IT their specialists.
• Provide technical expertise to the D2D team on data tools and change management processes to boost capacity of IFC’s clients and stakeholders to publish open data, use it for data visualizations and stories to help with decision making (e.g. by governments and companies), advocacy (e.g., by mining communities, CSOs, media), as well as for building new tools, such as mobile apps and web applications (e.g., by digital entrepreneurs and civic developers), to catalyze grass-roots development of data-driven solutions to help address challenges around access to information by communities and civil society organizations and to help build trust among mining sector stakeholders.
• Support other Sustainable Infrastructure Advisory projects in sectors beyond mining sector, as needed.

Data Analytics Capacity Building

• In coordination with the Natural Resource (NR) Data Analytics Curriculum team, design and deliver capacity building activities, creating new training products in a face-to-face as well as online modes. This will entail the development of training manuals, content for participants, scripts, trainer’s guides, and local implementation plans to ensure that the curriculum can be piloted in two of the D2D program’s countries (possibly Mongolia and Colombia) and eventually scaled in many other countries.
• Deliver in-country sessions of the new NR Data Analytics course as well as ad hoc client-tailored capacity building activities related to data management, visualization, and analysis in D2D program’s countries.

Project Management, Performance Measurement, and Communications

• In coordination with D2D’s Global team based in Washington, DC and staff based in the six program’s countries, lead implementation of D2D client-facing data activities, including use of open data for addressing information challenges for communities, media, natural resources companies, as well as national and subnational governments.
• Lead D2D’s internal data analytics work, performing different types of data analysis, supplementary data collection and extracting meaningful insights from collected data, including mining sector gender data.
• Draft concept notes, terms of reference, budget and implementation plans for innovative approaches focused on the use of open data and technology to promote transparency and accountability.
• Design metrics and KPIs for data activities to be continuously measured and evaluated.
• Lead data quality assurance in all data-related project deliverables.
